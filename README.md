We will do our best to make our code available to the public. At the same time, a bulk of Metaverse Law Library runs on software created by third parties (i.e., open source). In other words, we do not extend or modify original license created by third parties. See <a href="https://github.com/metaverselaw/lawlib/blob/main/LICENSE">license</a>.

# GRAV
Metaverse Law Library website runs on Grav. Grav is an open source flat-file CMS web-platform. Grav is available on Github <a href="https://github.com/getgrav/grav" target="_blank">here</a>.

# Text-to-Speech
We use Google AI for Text-to-Speech functionalities.

# Text Paraphraser
For sentence level paraphrases, we use T5 Text-to-Text generators. For paragraphs, we loop each sentence with T5, but this is not a friendly process for our non-coding members. So, we're planning to deploy a <a href="https://streamlit.io" target="_blank">Streamlit</a> application on local drive. This obviously takes time to build. In the meantime, we also use commercial vendors for paraphrasing tasks.
