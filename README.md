We will do our best to make our code available to the public. At the same time, a bulk of Metaverse Law Library runs on software created by third parties (i.e., open source), so we want to make it clear that <b>WE DO NOT EXTEND OR MODIFY ORIGINAL LICENSE CREATED BY THIRD PARTIES</b>. See <a href="https://github.com/metaverselaw/lawlib/blob/main/LICENSE">license</a>.

# Grav
Metaverse Law Library website runs on Grav. Grav is an open source flat-file CMS web-platform. Grav is available on Github <a href="https://github.com/getgrav/grav" target="_blank">here</a>.

# Text-to-Speech
We use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech" target="_blank">Google AI Text-to-Speech</a> functionalities.

# Text Paraphraser
For sentence level paraphrases, we use T5 Text-to-Text generators. For paragraphs, we loop each sentence with T5, but this is not a friendly process for our non-coding members. So, we're planning to deploy a <a href="https://streamlit.io" target="_blank">Streamlit</a> application on local drive. This obviously takes time to build. In the meantime, we also use commercial vendors for paraphrasing tasks.
